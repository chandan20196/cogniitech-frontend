        card1Description="Cogniitec develops agentic AI and focuses on analysing workflows, identifying the limits of autonomy and iterative controlled reasoning loops. The agentic development approach allows us to validate the tools we use, the safety conditions we have put in place when utilising those tools, and how reliably our tools will perform during execution. We offer structured agentic AI development cycles to ensure all automation agents behave as expected and incrementally as scales grow."

        sec1Title="Limited System Connectivity Restricting Agent Autonomy"
        sec1Description="In order for Agentic AI to function effectively, it is essential that organizations have unified access to their enterprise tools, data, and applications. If a company's systems are not connected, the most advanced Agentic AI Solution can only achieve a small part of the complete execution of a workflow with no way to coordinate the tasks or maintain reliable autonomous capabilities."

        sec2Title="Insufficient Context for Autonomous Decision Execution"
        sec2Description="Agentic AI can only operate effectively if it is paired with well-defined operational knowledge that is available in a structured way. The inability of agents to reason, adapt, and produce accurate real-time decisions emphasizes the importance of a strong agentic AI service provider in India to provide the base for contextual data."
