        card2Title="Automated Classification & Recommendations"
        card2Description="Cogniitec automates the ML/Big Data pipelines by providing pipeline management, uploading data into databases or data warehouses, data transformation, deploying the data, and continuous monitoring and analysis of the data along with the identification of changes in the characteristics of the data, called 'drift'. As a result, Cogniitec provides organisations with the means of standardising, accelerating and creating long-term reliability in their use of data science and machine learning solutions."

        card3Description="Cogniitec has developed an iterative process for refining decision processes. Through iterative model tuning, we establish the frameworks for decision-making in the most effective way based on behavioural patterns, feedback, and optimising their efficiency. As a data science and machine learning organisation, Cogniitec has developed sophisticated recommendation engines and intelligent models to assist customers in their decision-making by adapting to the behaviour of users and their organisations.

        sec1Title="Low-Quality Data Impacting Model Accuracy"
        sec1Description="Even though many companies create prototypes of machine learning solutions successfully, those prototypes oftentimes don’t lead to practical solutions, leaving many companies without the ability to take advantage of these models within their operations. If data science and machine learning systems are not placed within a disciplined engineering framework, then they will remain unused or not be effective as designed."

        sec2Title="Difficulty Operationalising ML Models at Scale"
        sec2Description="The majority of organizations fail to successfully transition their machine-learning prototype work to production. Organizations that do not have an effective machine-learning engineering process will likely have their machine-learning (ML) models sit idle and will miss the opportunity to connect them to their real-world workflows."
